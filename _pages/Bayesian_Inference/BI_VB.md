If we assume for a moment that our model is so complex that it is impossible  


In variational Bayesian (VB) analysis, the posterior distribution over unknown parameters is approximated by assuming it has certain properties such as factorising in a specific way or taking a specific parametric form. As we will see, this means that the true posterior distribution can never be exactly inferred.


In contrast to the stochastic sampling methods, deterministic methods approximate
the posterior distribution analytically by assuming it has certain properties such as
factorising in a specific way or taking a specific parametric form. This means that the
true posterior distribution can never be exactly inferred. In return, they are computationally
much less expensive in comparison to sampling methods. Additionally, they
approximate the model evidence along with the posterior distribution over unknown
parameters [87], which makes them particularly useful for the modelling task in this
thesis. The utility of such a parameter estimation technique in the field of glucose dy
