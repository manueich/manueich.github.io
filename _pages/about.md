# About me
I am a trained biomedical engineer with a Ph.D. in the field of mathematical modelling of metabolic processes. My core interest lies in the collection and analysis of data, as well as the develoment of mathemtical models for the benefit of soceity. In particular my interest lies in the field of endocrinology and biomedice in general. I have extensive skills and expertise in the following areas:
* Mathematical modelling of human blood glucose dynamics through nonlinear stochastic and deterministic differential equations
* Statistical inference and Bayesian model identification
* Scientific computing in MATLAB and Python
* Nonlinear Optimisation
* Design and implementation of experimental and clinical studies on human subjects
* Collection, processing and analysis of sound signals

Additional inforamtion on my publications, software projects and CV can be found on the follwing pages.
